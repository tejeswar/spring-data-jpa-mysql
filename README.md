Article link : https://www.mkyong.com/spring-boot/spring-boot-spring-data-jpa-mysql-example/


I had started this project to play with orm mappings with spring-data-jpa .
Then later on added code under com.mkyong.springdatajpa package to explore springdatajpa

Then I explore the concept of @Async annotation of spring,criteria builder etc...

YOu can find the explanation of the concepts in the videos also which is in google-vids
